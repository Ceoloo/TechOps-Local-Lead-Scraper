"""Local binding to the shared AION event contract.

Previously this module was a hand-vendored copy of the event envelope,
redaction, masking and validation logic. That logic now lives once, tested, in
the shared package ``aion_platform.contracts`` (in ``Ceoloo/aion-company-os``);
this module is a thin binding that keeps this repo's public surface unchanged
while delegating all the real work to the shared implementation.

What stays local to this repo:

* ``SOURCE_SERVICE`` / ``SOURCE_REPOSITORY`` -- this service's identity.
* ``LEAD_EVENTS`` / ``SERVICE_EVENTS`` / ``KNOWN_EVENTS`` -- the event families
  this repo is allowed to emit. The shared validator accepts the whole
  ecosystem vocabulary; this local allow-list keeps a typo or an out-of-scope
  event from leaving this service.

Everything else (``Event``, ``new_event``, ``validate_event``,
``redact_payload``, ``mask_value``, ``has_unmasked_sensitive``,
``SENSITIVE_KEYS``) is re-exported from the shared package so existing call
sites and tests keep working verbatim.
